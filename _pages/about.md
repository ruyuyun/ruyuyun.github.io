I am Ruyu Yun, in my **final year** as a **Ph.D. candidate** at [Institute for Digital Technologies, Loughborough University London](https://www.lborolondon.ac.uk/institutes/digital-technologies/). I'm specializing in ***neuromarketing* and *digital psychology***. My research focuses on understanding the dynamic interplay between technology and consumer behavior, particularly in the context of the changes brought about by Metaverse. 

Beyond academia, I have practical experience in teaching, consulting for start-up businesses, and working in dynamic environments across the UK and China. My diverse background informs my passion for uncovering the cognitive and psychological dynamics that drive technology-driven consumer experiences.
